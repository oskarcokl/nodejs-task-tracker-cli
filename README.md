# Task Tracker in Node-js

This is my solution for the [task tracker project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker) on roadmap.sh.

## Building the project

To build the project just run the following commands

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

## Run the project

To run the solution simple call the dist/main.js file. You might need to grant it execution privileges.

```sh
dist/main.js list
```
